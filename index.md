This website will capture some of the essence of my life and will be a lens into some of the things I enjoy the most in this world. Please buckle up for safety as we embark on this adventure!

### About Me

My name is Undre Stoker, but everyone calls me Dre! Yes like the "Dr." but not nearly as rich or famous. I am 30 years old and currently live in San Antonio, TX. I am originally from Houston, TX where I spent most of my elementary through high school years. I am just about done with my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Programming Technology with a projected graduation date of December 2021. I have a beautiful wife of 7 years and a overly energetic 2 year old son. I will be using my degree as a catalyst to hopefully one day become a Software Devolper for a large company such as Google or Facebook. I plan to immediately start working on a Graduate degree at the completion of this one. 

Currently career wise, I am a Special Agent with the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations. I have been grateful to have had a great career with the Air Force thus far and it has afforded me the ability to travel all across the world to places I'd never even dreamt of going. I started my career in the Air Force in 2010 as a Security Forces apprentice where I enjoyed 5 years defending the Air Force's greatest and most valuable resources. In 2015, I decided to broaden my horizons and become a federally credentialed Special Agent. In this time, I had the opportunity to do some really cool things that if I told you, I'd have to kill you! Yes that was a joke, and yes you can laugh out loud now. All jokes aside, I will share some of these experiences below. Outside of doing some secret squirrel stuff for the Air Force, I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and football. I enjoy video games, spending time with family, software development, music, and photography to name a few.

### My Faves

As I mentioned, I am a huge sports junkie and most of my time is spent watching the teams or players that I love. 
Being from Texas, of course I am a fan of America's Greatest Football team the Dallas Cowboys. 
You too can join in on the action by visiting their [official website](https://www.dallascowboys.com) to catch the next game!  

If you saw my above photos and want to see more of what my agency does, I encourage you to check out the AFOSI official [Twitter](https://twitter.com/RealAFOSI).

Lastly, I want to share one of my favorite YouTube creators who has published tons of content on Computer Programming. His page has helped me out tremendously with not only the classes at Southwestern but also my own personal goals of one day becoming a Software Developer. Check him out!
