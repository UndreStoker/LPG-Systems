### About Me

My name is Undre Stoker, but everyone calls me Dre! Yes like the "Dr." but not nearly as rich or famous. I am 30 years old and currently live in San Antonio, TX. I am originally from Houston, TX where I spent most of my elementary through high school years. I am just about done with my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Programming Technology with a projected graduation date of December 2021. I have a beautiful wife of 7 years and a overly energetic 2 year old son. I will be using my degree as a catalyst to hopefully one day become a Software Devolper for a large company such as Google or Facebook. I plan to immediately start working on a Graduate degree at the completion of this one. 

Currently career wise, I am a Special Agent with the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations. I have been grateful to have had a great career with the Air Force thus far and it has afforded me the ability to travel all across the world to places I'd never even dreamt of going. I started my career in the Air Force in 2010 as a Security Forces apprentice where I enjoyed 5 years defending the Air Force's greatest and most valuable resources. In 2015, I decided to broaden my horizons and become a federally credentialed Special Agent. In this time, I had the opportunity to do some really cool things that if I told you, I'd have to kill you! Yes that was a joke, and yes you can laugh out loud now. All jokes aside, I will share some of these experiences below. Outside of doing some secret squirrel stuff for the Air Force, I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and football. I enjoy video games, spending time with family, software development, music, and photography to name a few.
