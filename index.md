This website will capture some of the essence of my life and will be a lens into some of the things I enjoy the most in this world. Please buckle up for safety as we embark on this adventure!

### About Me

My name is Undre Stoker, but everyone calls me Dre! Yes like the "Dr." but not nearly as rich or famous. I am a Special Agent with the United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations. I have been grateful to have had a great career with the Air Force thus far and it has afforded me the ability to travel all across the world to places I'd never even dreamt of going. I started my career in the Air Force in 2010 as a Security Forces apprentice where I enjoyed 5 years defending the Air Force's greatest resources. In 2015, I decided to broaden my horizons and become a federally credentialed Special Agent. In this time, I had the opportunity to do some really cool things but if I tell you, I'd have to kill you! Yes that was a joke, and yes you can laugh out loud now. All jokes aside, I will share some of these experiences below. Outside of doing secret squirrel stuff for the Air Force, I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and football. I enjoy video games, spending time with family, software devolopment, music, and photography to name a few.
